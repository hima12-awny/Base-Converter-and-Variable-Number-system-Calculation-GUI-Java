# Handled some Exceptions
Like:
Like:
* "BigRemainder" : to avoid the occurrence of a non-letter value in the result.
* "Small Base" : when the Base is smaller than or equal to any digit of the input Number.
* "0-9 for decimal": when you type any (A-Z) in Number filed when you convert from decimal.
* "Invalid Base" : The Base is less than or equal to 1, or if it is a floats number.
* "Misformatted/Empty" if any input when:  
   - Empty.
   - Invalid Format: not include 0-9 or A-Z only in the number.
